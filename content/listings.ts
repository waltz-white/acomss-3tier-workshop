/**
 * listings.ts: YOUR CATALOG (you edit this file in Session 1)
 *
 * Each { ... } block below is one card in your catalog. Change the values,
 * add a block, or delete one. Put matching pictures in public/images/ and set
 * image_url to "/images/your-file-name.png".
 *
 * Before Session 2, the catalog shows these listings directly. In Session 2 you
 * copy them into your database from the /setup page, and from then on the
 * catalog reads from the database.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   - slug:         short name used in the page address (lowercase-with-dashes)
 *   - category:     CONSULTING | WEB_DEV | CUSTOM_SOFTWARE
 *   - inquiry_type: DEMO | QUOTE | INQUIRE  (decides which contact form shows)
 *   - image_url:    "/images/" + a file name in public/images/ (lowercase, exact)
 *
 * Editing tips (so the file keeps working):
 *   - Change only the words between the double quotes " ".
 *   - Keep the quotes, the comma at the end of each line, and the + that joins
 *     long text across lines.
 *   - Apostrophes are fine ("We're open"). For a quote inside your text, use
 *     single quotes ("Our 'quick start' plan").
 *   - Every slug must be different. When you copy a block to add a listing,
 *     change its slug first. Two listings with the same slug open the same page.
 *   - Red error screen after saving? You probably deleted a quote or a comma.
 *     Press Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac), save, and it comes back.
